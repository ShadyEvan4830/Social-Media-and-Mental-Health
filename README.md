# Welfare Expectations Across U.S. Economic Cycles

## Overview

This paper explores the American public's perception of government adequacy in providing welfare under varying economic conditions. It examines the relationship between economic cycles and public opinion on government welfare actions, seeking to understand if and how economic downturns, recoveries, and periods of growth influence public expectations and satisfaction with welfare provisions. Through analyzing public sentiment across different economic phases, the study aims to shed light on the effectiveness and responsiveness of welfare policies in addressing the needs of the population during times of economic change.

## Access to GSS Data

Due to licensing and copyright restrictions, we are unable to include the raw data from the General Social Survey (GSS) directly in this repository. The GSS data is essential for replicating the analysis presented in our study. To facilitate access to the necessary datasets, we provide detailed instructions below on how you can obtain the data directly from the source.

Step 1: Visit the GSS Website

The GSS data can be accessed through the NORC at the University of Chicago. Start by visiting the GSS website: [https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/4/vshow](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/191/vshow).

Step 2: Register for Access

To download the GSS data, you may be required to register for an account. This process is straightforward and ensures responsible use of the data. Follow the registration instructions provided on the GSS website.

Step 3: Locate the Relevant Datasets

Once registered, you can access the datasets. For our analysis, we utilized the data concerning "number of hours worked last week" spanning from 1972 to 2022. The GSS website provides a search and filter function to help you find specific datasets.

Step 4: Download the Data

After locating the relevant datasets, you can proceed to download them. The GSS website offers data in various formats, so choose the one that is most compatible with your analysis tools.

Step 5: Follow the Codebook

The GSS provides a comprehensive codebook detailing each variable and its coding. We strongly recommend reviewing the codebook to understand the dataset's structure, variables, and any changes over time that might affect your analysis.

Using the Data Responsibly

Please ensure that you use the GSS data in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by NORC. This typically includes using the data for research purposes only and citing the GSS appropriately in your work.
